    <h2>What is Pad Thai?</h2>
    <p>Pad Thai is a Thai noodle stir fry with a sweet-savoury-sour sauce scattered with crushed peanuts. 
        It’s made with thin, flat rice noodles, and almost always has bean sprouts, garlic chives, scrambled egg, 
        firm tofu and a protein – the most popular being chicken or prawns/shrimp</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>If using dried noodles, in a large pot or heatproof bowl, soak noodles in boiling water until tender, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large wok over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add shrimp and cook, turning halfway through, until just cooked through and pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>In same wok, heat 1 tablespoon oil. In a small bowl, whisk eggs until blended. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up curds with a spoon, until just set, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to bowl with shrimp.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk palm sugar, fish sauce, tamarind concentrate, lime juice, cayenne, 2 tablespoons oil, and 1 tablespoon water until combined.</li>
        <li>In same wok over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Cook shallot and garlic, stirring frequently, until lightly golden, about 1 minute. Add scallions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in sauce and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, shrimp, and noodles and cook, tossing constantly, until warmed through and noodles are softened, about 2 minutes more. Add bean sprouts and peanuts and toss again to combine. </li>
