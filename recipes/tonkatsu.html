    <p>Tonkatsu is a delicious Japanese dish made of juicy, tender pork coated in crispy panko breadcrumbs and fried until golden brown.
        It's served with a sweet and tangy tonkatsu sauce that's the perfect complement to this pork katsu. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless pork loin or pork chop </li>
        <li>Panko bread crumbs </li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Tonkatsu sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pound the pork loin or pork chop flat until it's about Â¾ inch thick. Using scissors or a knife, cut slits into the outer white membrane of the pork.
            This prevents it from curling up as it cooks. Next, coat it with flour and shake off the excess.</li>
        <li>Add a tablespoon of flour to the egg and mix them together. This creates a thicker egg wash that allows for more breadcrumbs to stick to.
            Dip the pork into the beaten egg and let the excess drip off.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pork to the panko bread crumbs and press firmly to create a thick layer of bread crumbs that won't flake off in the fryer. Be sure to cover any bare spots with breading.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil to 340 degrees F over medium heat. Medium heat is essential to cook the pork thoroughly without burning the bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Gently lower the pork cutlet into the fryer and deep fry it for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip and fry the other side until the pork is fully cooked and the panko coating is golden brown, about 5 more minutes.
            Try to keep the temperature at 340 degrees F for even cooking. Repeat with any remaining cutlets.</li>
    </ol>
